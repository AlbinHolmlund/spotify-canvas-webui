# spotify-canvas-webui
This project is a tool for fetching all canvas videos from an artist on Spotify, based on their name.  I use a lot of code from https://github.com/bartleyg/my-spotify-canvas/tree/master to get the canvas videos, but I wanted to be able to fetch all the videos for an artist, not just the currently playing song.
